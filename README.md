Yeah... I have made a site just for a English lesson.
The fun part was that i tested both of my "skill branches",
Programming, English, and Imagination! of course that not all of my skills,
but it's here to take note that was such a challenge for me.

This website have 157 lines of HTML code,
and 221 lines of CSS style sheets.
(excluding some additional server host java plugins)

And for finishing, I spend about 10 hours to make this... I want a break.
